  // As your dataset grows you might hit the default limit of 3000.
  // However you can increase this limit however you like and audit how it performs.
  // Or even set it to `Infinity` if you want to disable the limit.
  // documentLimit: 10000,

  // Another way to get around the `documentLimit` is to set `includeTypes` to just the document types that are used in preview mode.
  // You can run the `array::unique(*._type)` GROQ query in `Vision` in your Studio to see how many types are in your dataset.
  // Just be careful that you don't forget the document types you might be using in strong references, such as `project` or `sanity.imageAsset`
  // includeTypes: ['settings', 'project', 'page', 'sanity.imageAsset'],

  // If you have a lot of people in your Studio that are editing the content you're previewing
  // you could end up with a very high number of React rerenders. Normally this isn't a problem,
  // but should you hit a problem at scale you can adjust `subscriptionThrottleMs` to a higher value than the default `10` milliseconds.
  // Or if you're daring you could set it to `1` to have the lowest possible latency between edits and the live-preview.
  // subscriptionThrottleMs: 60,
